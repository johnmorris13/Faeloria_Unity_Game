# First_3D_Game
This is my first 3-dimensional game using Unity.
This game is completely based in C#. 
There can certainly be several updates to this game, but it is playable in the current state.
This project was completed for ITCS-4231 in Summer 2024. 
There are directions to playing the game in the menu screen.
The ZIP folder is 15 GB.
The game uses art and models from the Synty Studios Polygon Sample Pack : https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/5217
The background music is available here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BRcY4o06A0
Thank you for viewing and playing!
