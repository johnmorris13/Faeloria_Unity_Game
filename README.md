# First_3D_Game
This is my first 3-dimensional game using Unity.
This game is completely based in C#. 
There can certainly be several updates to this game, but it is playable in the current state.
This project was completed for ITCS-4231 in Summer 2024. 
There are directions to playing the game in the menu screen.
Thank you for viewing and playing!
